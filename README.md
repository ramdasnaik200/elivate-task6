## ✅ Steps Completed

### 1. Created Passwords of Varying Complexity

| Password             | Complexity Level |
|----------------------|------------------|
| apple123             | Weak             |
| qwerty               | Very Weak        |
| Summer2025           | Moderate         |
| ApplE2025!           | Strong           |
| T@xK7!mZ3qL#         | Very Strong      |
| Purple-Goose!River#99| Strong Passphrase|

| Password             | Strength      | Time to Crack  | Feedback                   |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| apple123             | Weak          | Seconds        | Too common, short          |
| qwerty               | Very Weak     | Instant        | Common keyboard pattern    |
| Summer2025           | Moderate      | Days           | Predictable word + number  |
| ApplE2025!           | Strong        | Years          | Good mix, needs more length|
| T@xK7!mZ3qL#         | Very Strong   | Centuries      | Excellent complexity       |
| Purple-Goose!River#99| Very Strong   | Centuries      | Long and well-formed       |

### 4. Best Practices Learned

- Use **12+ characters**
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**
- Avoid **dictionary words, dates, or patterns**
- Prefer **random phrases or password managers**
- **Do not reuse passwords** across platforms

---

### 5. Tips from Evaluation

- Length and randomness greatly enhance password strength.
- Even complex-looking passwords can be weak if based on real words.
- Password managers are useful for storing long, unique passwords.
- Passphrases (e.g., `Green-Book#Fly88`) are secure and memorable.

### 6. Common Password Attacks Researched

| Attack Type          | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force          | Tries all combinations until correct one is found.                      |
| Dictionary Attack    | Tries words from a dictionary or common password list.                   |
| Credential Stuffing  | Uses leaked credentials from previous data breaches.                     |
| Phishing             | Tricks users into revealing passwords using fake websites or emails.     |

### 7. Summary: How Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity is crucial in defending against automated attacks. Simple passwords like `apple123` can be cracked instantly, while complex ones like `T@xK7!mZ3qL#` may take centuries to crack. Strong passwords reduce the risk of brute-force and dictionary attacks significantly. Using random, lengthy combinations and password managers provides better security posture.

## 🔐 Recommendation

Use a trusted password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password) to generate and manage strong, unique passwords for every site.
